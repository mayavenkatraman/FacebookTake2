Assignment 1 for iOS for Designers class


Time taken : 8 - 10 hours

Tasks Completed: 

- Initial project setup, added all image assets, configured the app icon and splash screen
- Added a TabBar Controller, and connected five ViewControllers to it. Placed the header and body images appropriately in the ImageControlers for each of these ViewControllers. Configured the icons and titles of the tabs. Rearranged the tabs in the tab contoller to match the required order. 
- The Feed View page has a image view that contains the compose buttons
- clicking on the buttons causes the appropriate composer screen to appear (modal) , and clickin on cancel dismisses (not working in the last case)
- Clicking in the Thrill list page takes you to a details page. These pages are embedded in a navigation container, so that one page slides over the other like a stack of cards. On the details page. the like button activates on hover. 



Tasks Not completed
- nothing scrolls yet
- one of the cancel buttons does not work (modal transition)
- bouns tasks


Note: I travel out tomorrow. I will try and work with someone who is in the class to learn the scrolling functionaliy, which I feel is the large gap. It would be sweet to know how to do the two bonus features as well...
